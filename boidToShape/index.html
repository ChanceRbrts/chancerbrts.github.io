                A program that I ended up writing for Local Hack Day 2017.
                In this program, I implemented a variation of the 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids">Boid Algorithm.</a>
                From there, I then modified it by adding "attractors," which count as
                several Boids stacked on top of each other whose orientations move the
                Boids towards the attractors. I then had the attractors go in shapes to make
                "moving shapes."</br>
                This project was originally made with Processing.
                This is a remake of this project made with WebGL.

            A: Toggle the attractors being visible. </br>
            M: Make the points follow the mouse. </br>
            N: Toggle a Dark/Night Mode. </br>
            R: Toggle Color Mode. 
            Color Mode turns half the boids red and half of them blue, creating two flocks.</br>
            P: Toggle Drawing the points. </br>
            0-6: Toggle attractor patterns 0-6.
